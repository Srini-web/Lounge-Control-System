# Lounge-Control-System
This lounge control system is designed as a final presentation project of the Arduino Bootcamp course (2020). It is designed to deal with the flow of people into a lounge with the Covid-19 restrictions in mind. It consists of two parts. The first part is an entry limitation system that counts the entry of each opening the door for people while also letting them know when the maximum limited capacity is filled and restricts access. The code for this is present in the `Arduino_LCD.ino` file.

The second control segment monitors the temperatures of people entering while also dispensing hand sanitizer to all. This can be found in the `Arduino_handsanitizer.ino` file.

The two sub-systems work in tandem ensuring the restriction of entry to a limited number of healthy individuals. The same can be found in the file `Arduino_HandsanitiserandTemp.ino` file.
